## Backwards design

Designing educational curriculum by setting goals before choosing instructional methods and forms of assessment [[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design)]

--

1. **Identify** the results desired, focusing on the "big ideas" (principles, theories, concepts, point of views, or themes)
    - What should the students know, understand, and be able to do?
    - What are the goals and curriculum expectations?

--
2. **Determine** acceptable levels of evidence that support that the desired results have occurred
    - What will you/department as evidence that student understanding took place?
    - Consider culminating assessment tasks and a range of assessment methods (observations, tests, projects, etc.).

--
3. **Design** activities that will make desired results happen
    - What knowledge and skills will students need to achieve the desired results?
    - Consider teaching methods, sequence of lessons, and resource materials.
 
---

## Topic flow

- Create a schedule for the course with all the days you have available for teaching

--

- Mark any holidays

--

- Mark the day of the final exam/assessment (usually dictated by the university)

--

- Mark the days of midterm exams/assessments, keeping in mind mid-semester grade reporting dates

--

- Make a note of big ideas you want to have covered until each of the major assessments you have marked above

--

- Write out a list of topics you need to cover to achieve the learning goals for those major assessments

--

- Map the list of topics to teaching days

---

## What can you reasonably fit in one lecture?

--

# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ

--

- Less than you think!

--

- You can "fit" a lot more if you lecture non-stop, but...

--

- Keep in mind: "It's not what you teach, it's what they learn"

--

- Make additional time for activities

--

- Do not feel like you have to "cover" everything during an in person session
    - Readings, videos, homework assignments/labs, projects, etc.are all good and acceptable venues for presenting new material
    - While it's also ok to present new material in exams, most students won't be a fan of it (but extra credit questions are always an option)

---

## Other considerations

### Scheduling assignments and assessments

- Regularly scheduled (weekly, biweekly, etc.) homework is better than sporadic

--

- Aim for returning feedback and graded work for the first assignment before the second one is due

--

- Consider whether students will have received all graded work before a major assessment, e.g. an exam

--

- Lighten the load around major assessments

# Textbooks and other resources

---

## Various approaches to organizing content

- Closely follow a textbook: If you're teaching content that is well established, or that you've written a book on!
    - Extremely helpful for students in introductory courses
    - Also useful for you for the first time you're teaching

--

- Use various texts: If you're teaching content that is new/developing/not written on in textbook form, at least for the audience you're teaching
    - Requires you to be extra organized to make sure students are aware of which topic is being covered when
    - Need to consider accessibility of various sources, which may not be a small feat
    
--

- No textbook: Might be perfectly fine to not have a textbook, but no readings simply means you haven't done your job -- surely something is written about what you're teaching, even if you wrote it
    - You will need to write your assignments if there are no end of chapter exercises you can assign
    - Organization of content and communication of expectations is even more 

---

## Choosing resources

- Obviously the most important consideration is content
    - If this is not the first time the course is being taught, but it is your fist time teaching it, consider sticking with the existing textbook/resources

--

- Other considerations:
    - Flow of topics: it's not easy to jump around a textbook
    - Exercises: Either to assign as HW or for practice
    - Solutions to exercises: Some available to students, but not all!
        - Especially if a book has been around for a while, assume solutions are floating around
    - Cost: Is there an open source option?
        - Is the open source project "alive" and active?
    - Datasets: Are they available and easily accessible?
        - Some books come with an R package, it doesn't get any easier than that!
    - Teacher supplementary materials: Slides, sample exams, learning objectives, etc.
