### Week 1 - A fresh look at intro stats

#### Aug 28

#### Slides: [Intro stats and intro data science - Do we need both?](/slides/01-fresh-look/intro-stat-ds-need-both.pdf)

Slides are made in Keynote. Source file can be found [here](/slides/01-fresh-look/intro-stat-ds-need-both.key).

#### Discussion: 

- What do you know about a "traditional" intro statistics curriculum? What topics / contents from this curriculum should we hold on to? What can go, and why?
- What are biggest challenges to moving to a more computational intro statistics curriculum?
- What do you want to get out of this course? Add notes to [course Etherpad](https://oasis.sandstorm.io/shared/1AUhUNwW4pYO9aH9s8DczMjTELbCCFkf02ZJIBLfx2u).

#### Readings:

Usually readings will be posted the week prior so that you can read about the topic before the session. For the first class of the semester, readings are posted on the day of the first class. But they're not too extensive. Please read 
before next week, along with next week's readings.
