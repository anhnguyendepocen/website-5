### Class: 

Class is on Tuesdays, 3:05 - 4:20pm at Old Chem.

Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new ideas and provide pointers, but you will learn most in this class by actively discussing with classmates and completing teaching related exercises.

### Office hours

Office hours for this course are by appointment.

### Goals

- Become an effective teacher and communicator of statistics.
- Learn to be an efficient and effective teaching assistant.
- Learn about innovative pedagogical approaches for teaching college level statistics and data science.
- Develop a teaching statement.
- Practice teaching and give and receive feedback.

### Diversity & Inclusiveness:

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know!
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource. 
- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

### Class attendance 

Class attendance is a firm expectation; frequent absences or tardiness will be considered a legitimate cause for grade reduction. You must be in class on a day that you are scheduled to present, there are no make ups for presentations.

### Assessment

Assessment will be based on participation, improvement shown in sample teaching sessions, and the written teaching statement.

You must do your teaching session and write a teaching statement to pass this class.

### Academic integrity:

Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity. Cheating on exams and quizzes, plagiarism on homework assignments and projects, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the Duke Community Standard, and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved as well as being reported to the University Judicial Board. Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade. Please review Duke's Standards of Conduct.

Remember the Duke Community Standard that you have agreed to abide by:

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:

> - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
> - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
> - I will act if the Standard is compromised.

### Professionalism

Please refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class.
